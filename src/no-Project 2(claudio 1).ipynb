      "highlights: the trump presidency on april 13 at 9:30 p.m. edt/0130 gmt on friday (reuters) - highlights for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on thursday: the united states drops a massive gbu-43 bomb, the largest non-nuclear bomb it has ever used in combat, in afghanistan against a series of caves used by islamic state militants, the pentagon says. trump says pyongyang is a problem that “will be taken care of” amid speculation that north korea is on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. military force cannot resolve tension over north korea, china warns, while an influential chinese newspaper urges pyongyang to halt its nuclear program in exchange for beijing’s protection. the trump administration is focusing its north korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including intercepting cargo ships and punishing chinese banks doing business with pyongyang, u.s. officials say. trump says “things will work out fine” between the united states and russia, a day after declaring u.s.-russian relations may be at an all-time low. trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of janet yellen as federal reserve chair as he considers his choices for the u.s. central bank. [nl1n1hl14b] trump signs a resolution that will allow u.s. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners. democratic senator chris van hollen presses deutsche bank to release information about issues including trump’s debt and any bank meetings with trump administration officials, saying he has “great concern” about possible conflicts of interest. export-import bank trump’s office says he plans to revive the hobbled export-import bank of the united states, a victory for american manufacturers such as boeing co and general electric co that have overseas customers that use the agency’s government-backed loans to purchase their products. top wall street bankers say they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in washington, and downplay the idea u.s. policymakers may force their institutions to split up. the united states is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with japan, a source says, an unwelcome development for tokyo, which is seeking to fend off u.s. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. trump’s administration has focused on one group of illegal immigrants more than others: women with children, according to eight department of homeland security officials interviewed by reuters about agency planning.

      "highlights: the trump presidency on april 26 at 9:12 p.m. edt/0112 gmt on april 27 (reuters) - highlights for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on wednesday: trump proposes slashing tax rates for businesses and on overseas corporate profits returned to the country in a plan greeted as an opening gambit by his fellow republicans in congress. trump’s plan could shift the u.s. economy into higher gear but could have one effect the white house would not welcome — interest rates ratcheted higher than expected by a wary central bank. the trump tax cut will generate growth but not nearly enough to replace trillions of dollars in lost revenues, while rising deficits could even take back some of the economic gains, fiscal experts say. congress inches toward a deal to fund the government through september but is preparing to possibly extend a midnight friday deadline in order to wrap up negotiations and avoid an imminent government shutdown. trump is considering issuing an executive order to pull the united states from the north american free trade agreement, an administration official says, a move that could unravel one of the world’s biggest trading blocs. trump and canadian prime minister justin trudeau discuss bilateral trade in their second conversation in as many days  amid strains over softwood lumber and dairy. the trump administration says it aims to push north korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure, and remains open to negotiations to bring that about. trump gives the military the authority to reset a confusing system of troop limits in iraq and syria that critics say allows the white house to micro-manage battlefield decisions and ultimately obscures the real number of u.s. forces. trump signs an executive order to allow national monument designations to be rescinded or reduce the size of sites as the administration pushes to open more federal land to drilling, mining and other development. trump orders education secretary betsy devos to review the government role in school policy, which supporters cheer as a step in creating more local control in education and critics worry it could lead to lower quality schools in poorer neighborhoods. israel’s intelligence minister says his country wants an “understanding” with the trump administration that iran must not be allowed to establish a permanent military foothold in syria.

      "trump tries to rally support for healthcare bill washington (reuters) - president donald trump tried to rally republican lawmakers behind a plan to dismantle obamacare on tuesday as u.s. stock markets showed their worst one-day performance since the november election.  trump is trying to win the first major legislative battle of his presidency. pressure is growing on the businessman-turned politician to deliver as investors become worried that a failed healthcare push could also portend trouble for promised tax cuts and relaxed regulation that have propelled the market to record highs in recent months. in one of the few visits he has made to the u.s. capitol since taking office two months ago, trump told fellow republicans in the house of representatives on tuesday morning they would face “political problems” for opposing the bill that takes apart obamacare and partially replaces it. later in the day, trump hosted roughly a dozen lawmakers in the oval office to listen to their concerns. “the president was really clear: he laid it on the line for everybody,” house speaker paul ryan, the leading proponent of the bill, told reporters. “we made a promise. now is our time to keep that promise. ... if we don’t keep our promise, it will be very hard to manage this.” the s&p 500 and dow jones industrial average lost over 1 percent in their worst one-day performances since before trump’s election victory on nov. 8. the s&p financial index sank 2.87 percent, its biggest daily fall since june. “you have this back and forth in congress with the new healthcare plan and you have this belief that if the healthcare plan can’t pass, then they can’t move on to taxes. there’s this feeling that if things don’t get done, then maybe what the market has been anticipating gets held up,” said mark kepner, managing director at themis trading in chatham, new jersey.  some conservative lawmakers believe the healthcare bill does not go far enough, while moderate republicans worry that millions of americans will be hurt by the dismantling of the 2010 affordable care act, democratic former president barack obama's signature healthcare legislation. (for a graphic on how u.s. healthcare stacks up under the aca and ahca click tmsnrt.rs/2n0zmkf)  party leaders hope to move the bill to the house floor for debate as early as thursday. but the administration and house leadership can afford to lose only about 20 republican votes or risk the bill failing since democrats are united against it. republican representative mark meadows, chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus, said the roughly three dozen members have decided not to vote as a bloc. as many as 21 currently plan to vote no on the legislation, according to a cnn report. republican representative walter jones said trump told lawmakers in the closed-door meeting at the capitol that if the republican bill does not pass, they would face “political problems.” jones said he thought trump meant lawmakers could lose their seats. repealing and replacing obamacare was one of trump’s main campaign promises and has been a goal of republicans since it was enacted.  while trump predicted that republicans could face challenges in primary contests ahead of the 2018 midterm elections if they do not gut obamacare, there is also danger to them in doing so. if the republican bill is passed, millions of voters might lose their healthcare coverage. the congressional budget office said last week that 14 million people would forfeit coverage under the house bill over the next year, although that number could change based on the most current version of the legislation.  nancy nielsen, associate dean for health policy at the university at buffalo’s jacobs school of medicine, said republican leaders were in a tough spot. “it is a not-so-delicate balancing act, as they have to win over the most conservative house and senate members without causing an outrageous backlash from voters now or in the next election,” nielsen said.  democrats oppose the republicans’ plan, saying it would hurt the elderly, poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the wealthy.     republican leaders tweaked the bill this week to try to satisfy critics, mainly from their own party.  republican chairmen for two key committees said late monday they proposed more funding for tax credits, which conservatives have opposed, that would give the senate flexibility to help older people afford health insurance. additionally, obamacare’s taxes would be eliminated in 2017 instead of 2018. the amendments also addressed medicaid, which is the country’s largest health insurance program and covers about 70 million people, mostly the poor. the changes would allow states to implement work requirements for certain adults, an idea championed by many conservatives, and to decide how they receive federal funds.     congressman dan donovan, who attended the oval office meeting on tuesday, said trump did “more listening than directing.” there was some “political talk” but “no threats,” he said. donovan, who has not announced whether he will support the bill, cited people losing medicaid and the defunding of women’s healthcare provider planned parenthood as concerns in his new york district.  the club for growth, an influential conservative lobby group, said it would spend at least $500,000 for ads on television and digital platforms urging congress members to defeat the bill. the senate also will vote on the legislation, and more changes could be made. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said that if the house approved a healthcare bill, he would try to bring it to the senate floor next week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2\n",
      "trump warns 'rogue regime' north korea of grave danger beijing (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump arrived in china on wednesday seeking help to rein in north korea, telling the reclusive state’s leader he was putting his country in grave danger by developing nuclear weapons. trump used some of his toughest language yet against north korea in a wide-ranging address in seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses. he called on countries around the world to isolate pyongyang by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.” “do not underestimate us and do not try us,” trump told north korea as he wrapped up a visit to south korea with a speech to the national assembly before heading to beijing, where he was making his first official visit. trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive north, saying people were suffering in “gulags” and some bribed government officials to work as “slaves” overseas rather than live under the government at home. he offered no evidence to support those accusations. trump’s return to harsh, uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east asia of the risk of military conflict. on tuesday, trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to pyongyang to “make a deal.” he went mostly on the attack in wednesday’s speech but did promise a “path to a much better future” if north korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to “complete, verifiable and total denuclearization” – something pyongyang has vowed never to do. “we will not allow american cities to be threatened with destruction. we will not be intimidated,” he told south korean lawmakers. “and we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died to secure.” the north defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are u.s. plans to invade. the united states, which has 28,500 troops in south korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 korean war, denies any such intention.     “the world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation,” trump said, speaking as three u.s. aircraft carrier groups sailed to the western pacific for exercises - a rare show of such u.s. naval force in the region. ‘state visit-plus’ in beijing, trump and chinese president xi jinping resumed their “bromance” struck in april at trump’s mar-a-lago resort in florida, making small talk as they toured the forbidden city - which was shut down to tourists - with their wives before taking in a chinese opera performance. while the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a chinese leader to act as a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that china had promised for trump.   trump has threatened action over china’s wide trade surplus with the united states and called on beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor north korea, but has expressed admiration for xi and held off on imposing trade measures. during his two-day visit, trump will ask china to abide by u.n. resolutions and cut financial links with north korea, a senior white house official said on the plane from seoul. he also plans to discuss with xi the long-contentious trade imbalance, u.s. commerce secretary wilbur ross said at a ceremony with u.s. business leaders where $9 billion worth of deals were signed. the white house expects to announce deals in china this week worth more than $250 billion, bloomberg reported, citing an administration official. trump believes any talks with north korea would require it to reduce threats, end provocations and move toward denuclearization, and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization, the official added. trump and xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on thursday. before leaving for beijing, trump cited china as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties. “to those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” he said. while trump will try to convince xi to squeeze north korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions, it is not clear if xi, who has just consolidated his power at a communist party congress, will agree to do more. china has repeatedly said its leverage over pyongyang is exaggerated by the west and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions. the chinese foreign ministry said that china fully and strictly implements u.n. security council resolutions on north korea, but will investigate if there have been any contraventions. during his speech in seoul, trump directed his words at north korean leader kim jong un. “the weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” he said. “every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.” however trump, whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy, did not spell out any new approach. north korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland, something u.s. intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving. “north korea is a country ruled by a cult,” trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation.  he stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname “little rocket man” that he has used to describe the young north korean leader. kim, for his part, has called trump “mentally deranged.” the speech came after trump’s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating north and south korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing, officials said. a visit to the dmz, despite his aides’ earlier insistence he had no plans to go there, would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with north korea. arriving in beijing on wednesday, trump and his wife melania descended from a red-carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of air force one. that was in contrast to a 2016 visit to china by his predecessor, barack obama, who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub. and while in china, trump will not be deterred from using twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official. “the president will tweet whatever he wants,” the official told reporters on air force one. “i’m sure we’ve got the gear aboard this airplane to make it happen.”     2\n",
      "white house budget chief says any tax package would be retroactive washington (reuters) - white house budget chief mick mulvaney said on thursday that any tax reform package passed by congress

      "senate tax bill stalls on deficit-focused 'trigger' washington (reuters) - the u.s. senate on thursday delayed voting on a republican tax overhaul as the bill was tripped up by problems with an amendment sought by fiscal hawks to address a large expansion of the federal budget deficit projected to result from the measure. the senate debated the legislation late into thursday and adjourned, putting off any votes until friday morning. it was unclear if a decisive vote on the bill would occur then. the delay underscored nagging concerns among republican fiscal conservatives about the deficit impact of the bill. that set up the possibility that its deep tax cuts might have to be moderated, that future tax increases might be built in, and that some conservatives might seek to attach spending cuts, all approaches that could throw up new political problems. white house legislative affairs director marc short told reporters in the capitol: “i don’t think tax cuts are going to be scaled back. i think it would still be historic tax relief for corporations and for middle-income families.”  the tax bill is seen by republicans as crucial to their prospects in the november 2018 elections, when they will fight to keep control of the senate and the house of representatives. since taking office in january, president donald trump and  republicans now in control of congress have yet to pass major legislation, a fact they hope to change with their proposed tax- code overhaul, which would be the biggest since the 1980s. democrats, expected to unanimously oppose the tax bill, have dismissed it as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations. republican senator bob corker and others had tried to add a provision to the bill to trigger automatic future tax increases if the tax cuts in the bill did not boost the economy and generate revenues sufficient to offset the deficit expansion. but the senate parliamentarian barred corker’s “trigger” proposal on procedural grounds. the trigger amendment was needed to win corker’s vote and those of others worried about the deficit - worries that intensified when congressional analysts said the bill would not boost the economy enough to offset the estimated deficit expansion, as the trump administration had said it would. senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch told reporters in the capitol that it had not been easy to accommodate corker, senator jeff flake and other fiscal hawks. “it’s been pretty hard to make them happy so far. we’re going to keep working on it ... and we’re going to do it,” hatch said. senate republicans were considering making a proposed corporate income tax rate cut temporary, instead of permanent, so the rate would rise back to an unknown level after six or seven years, said one republican senator and an aide. by that time, trump might no longer be in office and a future congress might change the law. when asked if the tax bill was in trouble, republican senator mike rounds told reporters: “no, i don’t think so. it’s just a matter of once again trying to make the bill work.” optimism had reigned earlier in the day, when the bill won the backing of republican senator john mccain. stocks surged on hopes that a key tax overhaul vote was imminent. the s&p 500 hit a record closing high and the dow jones industrial average topped the 24,000 mark for the first time. but the joint committee on taxation, or jct, a nonpartisan fiscal analysis unit of congress, said the bill as passed earlier by the senate finance committee, would generate only $407 billion in new tax revenue from increased economic growth. jct had earlier estimated the tax bill would balloon the $20 trillion national debt by $1.4 trillion over 10 years. the new estimate, counting “dynamic” economic effects, put the deficit expansion at $1 trillion, far short of assertions by some republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said the new jct estimate showed “no amount of dynamic scoring fairy dust will fix the catastrophic deficits of the gop tax scam.” mccain, a key player in july’s collapse of a republican effort to gut obamacare, backed the tax bill. while “far from perfect,” the party’s 2008 presidential nominee said it would boost the economy and help all americans. republican senator susan collins, who also played a role in the failure of the obamacare rollback, told reporters she was still not committed to the bill. several republicans were withholding support while pushing for including a federal deduction for up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes and bigger tax breaks for “pass-through” companies, including small businesses. as drafted, the senate bill would cut the u.s. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one-year delay and reduce the tax burden on businesses and individuals, while ending many tax breaks, but would still expand the deficit, trump wants to enact tax cuts before january. the house approved its own tax bill on nov. 16. it would have to be merged with the senate bill, if it is approved, before any final measure could go to trump for his signature.  republicans have 52 votes in the 100-member senate, giving them enough to win if they hold together. with democrats opposed, republicans could lose no more than two of their own votes, with vice president mike pence able to break a 50-50 tie. trump has attacked corker and flake on twitter. both senators are not seeking re-election. in early october, the president called corker, “liddle’ bob corker” in a tweet. corker tweeted that the trump white house was an “adult daycare center.” days later, he called trump a liar who had damaged u.s. standing in the world. trump tweeted back saying corker “couldn’t get elected dog catcher.” trump earlier this month tweeted that flake’s political career was ‘toast’” in a dramatic senate speech, flake said u.s. politics had become inured to “reckless, outrageous and undignified” behavior from the white house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     2\n",
      "under pressure from trump, price resigns as health secretary over private plane uproar washington (reuters) - u.s. health and human services secretary tom price resigned under pressure from president donald trump on friday in an uproar over price’s use of costly private charter planes for government business. his abrupt departure was announced an hour after trump told reporters he was disappointed in price’s use of private aircraft and did not like the way it reflected on his administration. “secretary of health and human services thomas price offered his resignation earlier today and the president accepted,” the white house said in a statement. trump named don wright to serve as acting secretary. wright is currently the deputy assistant secretary for health and director of the office of disease prevention and health promotion. “i’m not happy. ok? i’m not happy,” trump told reporters on the white house south lawn. candidates to succeed price included seema verma, who is administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and who is close to vice president mike pence, and scott gottlieb, a physician who serves as commissioner of the food and drug administration, according to industry analysts. several sources saw gottlieb as a clear front runner. they said he got along well with the white house and is viewed favorably there. price’s resignation leaves trump with a second cabinet position to fill. he has yet to pick a secretary for homeland security after hiring former secretary john kelly as his white house chief of staff.     it was the latest blow to the trump white house, which has struggled to get major legislative achievements passed by congress and has been embroiled in one controversy after another since trump took office in january. price, a former congressman, was instrumental in the trump administration’s policies aimed at undercutting obamacare, as well as working with governors across the country to slowly begin unraveling parts of the law. in a resignation letter, price offered little in the way of contrition. he said he had been working to reform the u.s. healthcare system and reduce regulatory burdens, among other goals. “i have spent forty years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first. i regret that the recent events have created a distraction from these important objectives,” he said. trump, currently trying to sell his tax cut plan and oversee the federal response to devastation wreaked by three hurricanes, saw the price drama as an unnecessary distraction and behind the scenes was telling aides “what was he thinking?,” a source close to the president said. price promised on thursday to repay the nearly $52,000 cost of his seats on private charter flights. “the taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes,” price said. but that was not enough to satisfy trump. trump told reporters that the “optics” of price’s travel were not good, since, as president he was trying to renegotiate u.s. contracts to get a better deal for taxpayers. “look, i think he’s a very fine person. i certainly don’t like the optics,” trump said. price had also been seen in the white house as having been ineffective in getting congress to pass healthcare reform legislation, an effort that has fizzled on capitol hill. price was one of a handful of senior officials in trump’s administration put on the defensive over reports about their use of charter flights and government aircraft, sometimes for personal travel, when they could have flown commercial for less money. the white house issued an order late on friday saying use of private planes required approval from white house chief of staff john kelly and that the commercial air system was appropriate even for very senior officials with few exceptions. the washington post on friday reported that veterans affairs secretary david shulkin attended a wimbledon tennis match, toured westminster abbey and took a cruise on the thames this summer during a 10-day trip to discuss veterans’ health issues in britain and denmark. shulkin, who traveled on a commercial airline, was accompanied on the trip by his wife, whose airfare was paid for by the government and who received a per diem for meals, the post said, noting that the department of veterans affairs said she was traveling on “approved invitational orders.” his six-person traveling party included an acting undersecretary of health and her husband as well as two aides. they were accompanied by a security detail of as many as six people, the post said.  washington news media outlet politico has reported that price had taken at least two dozen private charter flights since may at a cost to u.s. taxpayers of more than $400,000. politico also reported he took approved military flights to africa and europe costing $500,000. senior u.s. government officials travel frequently, but are generally expected to keep costs down by taking commercial flights or the train when possible. environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt and treasury secretary steve mnuchin have also been in the spotlight for their travel habits.

      "two ex-trump aides charged in russia probe, third pleads guilty washington (reuters) - federal investigators probing russian interference in the 2016 u.s. election charged president donald trump’s former campaign manager paul manafort and another aide, rick gates, with money laundering on monday.  a third former trump adviser, george papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early october to lying to the fbi, it was announced on monday. it was a sharp escalation of u.s. justice department special counsel robert mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged russian efforts to tilt the election in trump’s favour and into potential collusion by trump aides. manafort, 68, a longtime republican operative, and gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in washington.  both men pleaded not guilty to the charges in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of ukraine’s former pro-russian government. the judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million (7.57 million pounds) unsecured bond for manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for gates. with unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. there will be another hearing on thursday. the developments in the mueller probe weighed on the u.s. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies. mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over trump’s first nine months in office. u.s. intelligence agencies say russia interfered in the election by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton. russia denies the allegations and trump denies any collusion. neither trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against manafort and gates. the charges, some going back more than a decade, centre on manafort’s work for ukraine. the indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the united states, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the u.s. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.     a white house spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and russia.  “we’ve been saying from day one there’s no evidence of trump-russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman sarah sanders told a news briefing. manafort’s attorney, kevin downing said in a statement that there was no evidence the trump campaign colluded with the russian government. downing said manafort’s work for the ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the trump campaign. downing accused mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the department of justice when they are doing work for a foreign government. in a development directly related to trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on monday that papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to federal bureau of investigation agents.         mueller’s office said papadopoulos lied to fbi agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in london who claimed to have information that would hurt clinton.     papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain that stated he had since “met with the government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document. sanders, the white house spokeswoman, said papadopoulos’ role in the campaign was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer. “he asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said. in a may 4 email quoted in the papadopoulos indictment, a trump campaign employee forwarded a message from papadopoulos proposing a meeting between trump and the russian government to another campaign official. the employee included a note, according to the indictment, that read: “let’s discuss. we need someone to communicate that dt is not doing these trips. it should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.” a source in washington, who did not want to be identified and who has seen the email, said the sender was manafort and the recipient was gates. manafort ran the trump campaign from june to august of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-russian political party in ukraine.     trump reiterated his frustration on monday with the mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” “sorry, but this is years ago, before paul manafort was part of the trump campaign. but why aren’t crooked hillary & the dems the focus?????,” trump wrote on twitter, referring to clinton. mueller has been investigating manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the party of regions, which backed former pro-kremlin ukrainian president viktor yanukovich. both manafort and gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from ukraine work and laundered money through scores of u.s. and foreign entities to hide payments from american authorities, the indictment said.  they concealed from the united states their work and revenue as agents of ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said. the indictment said manafort owned properties in manhattan,  brooklyn, the hamptons, arlington, virginia, and elsewhere. prosecutors said manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in beverly hills, california, and new york city. they also said he had been making payments on four range rovers and a mercedes-benz. gates was a longtime business partner of manafort and has ties to russian and ukrainian oligarchs. he also served as deputy to manafort during his brief tenure as trump’s campaign chairman.

      "highlights: the trump presidency on april 28 at 8:45 p.m. edt/0045 gmt april 29 (reuters) - highlights for u.s. president donald trump’s administration on friday: the trump administration could respond to north korea’s latest failed missile test by speeding plans for new u.s. sanctions against pyongyang, including possible measures against specific north korean and chinese entities, a u.s. official says. secretary of state rex tillerson warns failure to curb north korea’s nuclear and missile development could lead to “catastrophic consequences” while china and russia rebuke washington for its threat of force. trump signs a bill approved by the republican-led congress to avert a u.s. government shutdown and give lawmakers another week to work out federal spending through sept. 30, with tricky issues like defense spending still unresolved. trump pledges to uphold americans’ right to possess guns in a speech that he uses to revisit some 2016 election campaign themes from his vow to build a border wall to dismissing democratic senator elizabeth warren as “pocahontas.” trump tells reuters he will either renegotiate or terminate what he calls a “horrible” free trade deal with south korea and says seoul should pay for a u.s. anti-missile system he prices at $1 billion. a 5-year-old u.s.-south korean trade deal could be improved to increase access for american vehicles and deter currency manipulation but changes will not necessarily shrink the u.s. trade deficit with the asian export powerhouse. obama-era regulations lawmakers, lobbyists and interest groups are making a final push in their fight over regulations enacted during former president barack obama’s last months in office, with the financial services industry working hard to kill a rule on retirement plans run by states. trump signs an executive order to extend offshore oil and gas drilling to areas that have been off limits — a move meant to boost domestic production but that could fall flat due to weak industry demand for the acreage. a u.s. appeals court grants a trump administration request to put on hold a legal challenge by industry and a group of states to obama administration regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, rules trump is moving to undo. in an unexpected triumph for privacy advocates, the u.s. national security agency says it has stopped a form of surveillance that allowed warrant-less collection of the digital communications of americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages.

      "former trump security aide was russia blackmail risk: ex-u.s. official washington (reuters) - former acting u.s. attorney general sally yates said on monday she warned the white house in january that then-national security adviser michael flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by russia. yates testified at a senate judiciary subcommittee hearing that focused primarily on flynn, and did not shed much light on other aspects of investigations of allegations that russia meddled in the 2016 u.s. election and whether there was collusion between president donald trump’s campaign and moscow. yates repeatedly declined to discuss details of the investigation in a public forum. former director of national intelligence james clapper, who also testified, said he stood by past assertions that he had not seen evidence of such collusion but also declined to comment on classified matters. yates briefly led the u.s. justice department until trump fired her on jan. 30 for declining to defend his travel ban on seven muslim-majority countries. she told white house counsel don mcgahn on jan. 26, less than a week into trump’s presidency, that flynn had not been telling the truth about his contacts with russia’s ambassador to washington. making her first public statements about the issue, yates said she feared moscow could try to blackmail flynn because it also knew he had not been truthful about conversations he had with ambassador sergei kislyak about u.s. sanctions on russia. flynn, a retired general once seen as a potential trump vice president, has emerged as a central figure in the russian probes. russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the trump administration denies allegations of collusion with russia.                  yates told the hearing she had been concerned that “the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the russians.” “logic would tell you that you don’t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the russians have leverage over him,” she said. trump, who continued to praise flynn, waited 18 days after yates’ warning before flynn’s forced resignation for failing to disclose the content of his talks with kislyak and then misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations.  several democratic senators questioned trump’s delay. yates said that in her meetings, mcgahn “demonstrated that he understood this was serious. .. if nothing was done, certainly that would be concerning.” during that section of the hearing, clapper described as accurate a report in the guardian newspaper that british intelligence officials became aware in late 2015 about suspicious interactions between trump advisers and russian agents, and that the information was passed on to u.s. intelligence agencies. “yes, it is (accurate), and it’s also quite sensitive,” clapper said. yates was a holdover from the administration of president barack obama. obama had warned trump, then president-elect, not to give the post of national security adviser in his administration to flynn just after the republican’s surprise victory in the nov. 8 election, a former obama aide said.     the warning, first reported by nbc news, came up during a discussion of white house personnel. white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters obama had communicated concerns about flynn. it “shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone, given that general flynn had worked for president obama, was an outspoken critic of president obama’s shortcomings,” spicer said.     obama pushed flynn out in 2014 from his job as director of the military’s defense intelligence agency, or dia. congressional committees began investigating after u.s. intelligence agencies concluded that russian president vladimir putin ordered hacking of democratic political groups to try to sway the election toward trump. the main investigations are being conducted by congressional intelligence committees, although democrats have clamored for a special prosecutor or independent committee. they argue that congressional committees are too partisan to conduct credible probes. after monday’s hearing, trump took to twitter to bash the media and deny any collusion. “director clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is ‘no evidence’ of collusion w/ russia and trump,” he said. and in another tweet, the president seemed to denounce the hearings. “the russia-trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?” he asked. fbi director james comey testified in the house on march 20 that the agency was investigating potential links between trump associates and moscow’s attempts to tilt the election. trump had also used twitter before the hearing to insinuate that yates had leaked information on flynn to the media. yates and clapper both swore under oath that they had never leaked classified information. questioning on monday often broke along party lines.     some republicans veered away from russia to focus on issues such as whether the obama administration had improperly revealed the names of trump associates contained in surveillance records.  senator john cornyn, the no. 2 republican in the senate, was one of a handful who grilled yates about her objections to trump’s travel ban. trump fired yates after she defied the white house on the travel ban, a policy that trump said would help protect americans from islamist militants.

      "trump urges nfl to ban players kneeling during anthem (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump ramped up his fight with the national football league on tuesday, calling on the league to ban players from kneeling in protest at games while the national anthem is played. “the nfl has all sorts of rules and regulations. the only way out for them is to set a rule that you can’t kneel during our national anthem!” trump wrote on twitter. for the fifth straight day the president denounced the symbolic gesture, which has been adopted by some black players in the last year to protest against racial disparities in the criminal justice system. an nfl spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. trump praised two teams that played on monday night and largely steered clear of the controversy. the arizona cardinals linked arms and stood for the “star-spangled banner” along with the dallas cowboys, who knelt before the song. last friday, trump told a political rally any protesting player was a “son of a bitch” who should be fired, and urged a boycott of nfl games, triggering protests by dozens of players, coaches and some owners before sunday’s games.  trump’s verbal assault may appeal to his conservative base as the republican president grapples with critical issues including north korea’s nuclear threats, a humanitarian crisis in hurricane-struck puerto rico, an investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election and the healthcare struggle in congress. paul ryan, the most senior republican in the u.s. house of representatives, said he also disapproved of the gesture.  “people are clearly within their rights to express themselves how they see fit,” he told reporters. “my own view though is that we shouldn’t do it on the anthem.”  u.s. attorney general jeff session told an audience at washington’s georgetown law school that the protesting athletes were wrong. “the players aren’t subject to any prosecution, but if they take a provocative act, they can expect to be condemned,” he said. hillary clinton, trump’s democratic rival in the 2016 election, called trump’s comments “a huge, loud dog whistle to his supporters” in an interview with cbs. former san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick first kneeled during the anthem last year to protest police shootings of unarmed black men.  his former teammate eric reid wrote in a new york times opinion article that he and kaepernick chose to kneel as a “respectful” gesture, comparing it to “a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.”

      "republicans unveil tax cut bill, but the hard work awaits washington (reuters) - u.s. house of representatives republicans unveiled long-delayed legislation on thursday to deliver deep tax cuts that president donald trump has promised, setting off a frantic race in congress to give him his first major legislative victory. the 429-page bill, representing what would be the largest overhaul of the u.s. tax system since the 1980s, called for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cutting tax rates on individuals and families and ending certain tax breaks for companies and individuals. congressional passage of this legislation that would affect nearly every u.s. company and family was far from certain, and some business groups quickly came out against it. contentious provisions will test republicans, who control the white house and both chambers of congress but have been unable to deliver any major legislative achievements for trump since the businessman-turned-politician became president in january. a number of provisions would hit taxpayers in democratic-leaning states hardest, like rolling back deductions for state and local taxes and cutting in half the popular mortgage interest deduction.  the legislation, called the tax cuts and jobs act, produces new advantages for rich americans through lowered corporate taxes, phasing out the estate tax and dumping the alternative minimum tax.  “this is a very important and special moment for our country, for all americans. are we going to let the defenders of the status quo win and see our country continue down this downward spiral?” republican house speaker paul ryan asked, despite data showing about eight straight years of economic growth. meeting with ryan and other key house republicans, trump told the lawmakers he was counting on them to maintain the momentum for tax cuts, and repeated his request that congress send him the legislation to sign into law by the u.s. thanksgiving holiday on nov. 23. that is an ambitious timetable for such a long, multi-faceted piece of legislation that will face a ferocious lobbying battle among business sectors affected by the bill and fierce opposition from many democrats. trump called the bill an “important step” toward tax relief for americans, adding in a statement, “we are just getting started, and there is much work left to do.” the bill presented by the tax-writing house ways and means committee would consolidate the current number of tax brackets to four from seven: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. an earlier republican tax outline had called for cutting the top rate for the highest earners to 35 percent. the national association of home builders blasted the legislation, saying it would damage home prices and punish homeowners in urban areas.  “we’re concerned if enacted, this bill will throw us back into another housing recession,” jerry howard, the group’s president, said in an interview. the group said the provision in the bill capping the interest deduction for future home purchases at $500,000 - half the current amount - was unacceptable. howard said 7 million homes are currently above $500,000 and in high-cost regions like washington, d.c., new york city, california and hawaii, the impact would be felt the most.  the bill would repeal the existing deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, and would cap the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000. those provisions would most affect americans in higher-tax states such as california, new york, new jersey, pennsylvania and illinois. the national federation of independent business, the influential small business lobby, also came out against the bill, while the u.s. chamber of commerce business lobby backed it. ryan said the typical family of four would save $1,182 annually on taxes under the bill.  with democrats solidly opposed to legislation they see as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would expand the federal deficit, republicans can ill afford to lose many in their own ranks as they aim to pass the bill in the coming weeks. “ultimately, what the american people really get from this tax plan is a huge bill for the debt incurred to pay for tax breaks that line the pockets of donald trump personally along with his billionaire buddies. like a trump university degree, it is phony,” said democratic congressman lloyd doggett. the bill’s architects avoided one showdown by deciding not to make changes to the popular tax-deferred 401(k) retirement savings program. the bill would roughly double the standard deduction for individuals and families. but it would repeal a personal exemption of $4,050 that taxpayers can currently claim for themselves, their spouse and any dependents. the legislation would also phase out tax-exempt financing for sports stadiums and subject large private universities to 1.4-percent excise tax on investment income. it would also repeal a long standing prohibition on religious institutions being involved in political activities. the bill would create a new family tax credit and double exemptions for estate taxes on inherited assets, while also allowing small businesses to write off loan interest. the bill would cap the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises at 25 percent, down from the present maximum rate on “pass-through” income of 39.6 percent. it would set standards for distinguishing between individual wage income and actual pass-through business income to prevent tax-avoidance abuse of the new, lower tax level. it would create a new 10-percent tax on u.s. companies’ high-profit foreign subsidiaries, calculated on a global basis, in a move to prevent companies from moving profits overseas. foreign businesses operating in the united states would face a tax of up to 20 percent on payments they make overseas from their american operations. u.s. equities have rallied in 2017 to a series of record highs, partly on expectations of deep corporate tax cuts. shares of u.s. homebuilders fell after the bill was released, with luxury homebuilders including toll brothers taking the biggest hit. as investors parsed its provisions, the dow jones industrial average was up modestly and the s&p 500 was down slightly. investors cautioned the tax plan was preliminary and it was too soon to gauge the effect on specific industries.

      "'nuclear option' fallout? more extreme u.s. justices, experts say washington (reuters) - a republican-backed senate rule change expected on thursday could make it more likely that presidents will pick ideologically extreme u.s. supreme court nominees with little incentive to choose centrist justices, experts said. with a deep partisan divide in washington, democrats are using a procedural tactic called a filibuster to try to block confirmation of president donald trump’s supreme court nominee neil gorsuch in the republican-led senate. majority leader mitch mcconnell has threatened to change long-standing rules in the 100-seat senate if the democrats succeed with the filibuster in order to prohibit the tactic against supreme court nominees. that would mean such nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority rather than needing to first muster a 60-vote super-majority. experts said the rule change, called the “nuclear option,” could produce an ever-more ideologically polarized supreme court. over the years with the senate narrowly divided, the filibuster rule has meant that presidents have needed to make appointments who could win at least a few votes from the other party. for the court, the prospect of a filibuster has shaped the way presidents pick nominees, said stephen wermiel, a supreme court scholar at the american university washington college of law. “although it has not been widely used, the idea that it was there as a deterrent to presidents appointing justices who might be considered extreme has been a significant factor,” wermiel said.  republican senator john mccain, a defender of senate traditions, warned of the consequences of the rule change, though he said he would reluctantly support the move. “we will see more and more nominees from the extremes of both left and right,” mccain said. “i do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary. in fact, i think the opposite will be true, and americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the law.” republican senator lindsay graham said supreme court  nominees “are going to be more ideological, not less” with the rule change, which he warily supported. the nuclear option would erase “the last shred of bipartisanship in the senate confirmation process,” said senate democratic leader chuck schumer, who led the filibuster against gorsuch. elimination of the filibuster for supreme court nominees could matter most with the next vacancy on the nine-seat court after gorsuch, who was nominated by trump to replace justice antonin scalia, who died last year. three current justices are 78 or older: liberal ruth bader ginsburg is 84; conservative anthony kennedy, who sometimes sides with the court’s liberals in big cases, is 80; and liberal stephen breyer is 78. having more justices who are ideologically extreme would make compromise among them harder and lead to rulings the public may view as based more on a political agenda than the law, said university of massachusetts, amherst political science professor paul collins, co-author of a book on supreme court confirmation hearings.  if confirmed as expected on friday, gorsuch would restore the court’s 5-4 conservative majority. overturning the landmark 1973 roe v. wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide may become more likely if there is no filibuster to moderate the choice of future court nominees, wermiel said. without a filibuster, a future democratic president with a democratic-led senate could feel free to name a justice from the dogmatic left. the result would be a court even more polarized than the current one already is perceived to be, said brookings institution think tank expert russell wheeler said. “an ideologically-driven administration would eschew middle-of-the-road judges,” wheeler said. “they would stack the court with ideological soulmates.” trump advisor leonard leo said the best way to avoid extreme nominees is through the electoral process. trump made it clear during the 2016 presidential campaign he would pick from a list of potential supreme court nominees that he made public, and the voters elected trump, leo said.  “people knew or should have known what they were getting when he was elected president,” leo said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            2\n",
      "trump jr. emails suggest he welcomed russian help against clinton washington (reuters) - president donald trump’s eldest son eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about democratic white house rival hillary clinton as part of moscow’s official support for his father, according to emails released on tuesday. the emails, released by donald trump jr., are the most concrete evidence yet that trump campaign officials welcomed russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over trump’s presidency and spurred investigations by the justice department and congress. the messages show that the younger trump was open to the prospect of “very high level and sensitive information” from a russian attorney that a go-between described as “part of russia and its government’s support for mr. trump” ahead of a meeting on june 9, 2016.  \"if it's what you say i love it,\" trump jr. responded. he released the messages on twitter after the new york times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him. (bit.ly/2uapeck and bit.ly/2ua9hwg)     in an interview with fox news, trump jr. said that trump’s campaign manager at the time, paul manafort, and son-in-law jared kushner, now a top white house adviser, also attended the meeting with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya, who denies having kremlin ties. he said veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss russian sanctions. “in retrospect, i probably would have done things a little differently,” he said. “for me, this was opposition research.” nevertheless, the correspondence between him and rob goldstone, a publicist who arranged the meeting, could provide fodder for u.s. investigators probing whether trump’s campaign colluded with the kremlin. “the crown prosecutor of russia ... offered to provide the trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father,” goldstone wrote trump jr. on june 3. russia does not have a “crown prosecutor” - the equivalent title is prosecutor general. u.s. intelligence agencies have concluded that moscow sought to help trump win the election, in part by releasing private emails from democratic party officials. “the conversation will now turn to whether president trump was personally involved or not. but the question of the campaign’s involvement appears settled now,” cornell law school professor jens david ohlin said in an interview. “the answer is yes.”  moscow has denied any interference, and trump says his campaign did not collude with russia. trump jr. said he did not tell his father about the meeting. he said he may have since had contact with other russians. “i’ve probably met with other people from russia, but certainly not in the context of actual formalized meetings or anything,” he said on fox news. the news jarred financial markets as investors worried it presented a fresh distraction from the administration’s economic agenda. stocks and the dollar fell, while u.s. treasury securities gained ground. stocks later retraced most of their losses after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell pledged to keep lawmakers in washington longer than scheduled to push through a bill to overhaul healthcare. along with his younger brother eric, trump jr. oversees the trump organization, his father’s real-estate and business empire, and does not have a formal role in the white house. “my son is a high-quality person and i applaud his transparency,” trump said in a statement. the white house referred questions to lawyers for trump and his son. the emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say trump jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities. he is likely to face scrutiny from both congressional committees investigating the matter.  the senate intelligence committee plans to call on him to testify and to provide documents, according to a senate source, while the house of representatives intelligence committee wants to interview him and everybody else involved in the meeting, said the panel’s top democrat, representative adam schiff. “the american people need to know that our president is acting on their behalf and not acting because he has a fear that the russians could disclose things that would harm him or his family,” schiff told reporters. on fox news, trump jr. said he was “more than happy to cooperate with everyone.” senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley, a republican, asked the trump administration how veselnitskaya was able to enter the united states even though her authorization had expired. cnn reported that special counsel robert mueller, who is heading a criminal investigation at the justice department, also planned to look into the meeting. vice president mike pence, who has said the campaign had no contacts with russia, said through a spokesman he was not aware of the meeting, held before he became trump’s running mate later that summer. senator lindsey graham, a south carolina republican who is at times harshly critical of trump, told reporters: “this is very problematic. we cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody’s campaign and say: ‘we’d like to help you.’”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2\n",
      "trump asks supreme court to block travel ban ruling washington (reuters) - the u.s. justice department on friday asked the supreme court to block a judge’s ruling that prevented president donald trump’s travel ban from being applied to grandparents of u.s. citizens and refugees already being processed by resettlement agencies. in a court filing, the administration asked the justices to overturn thursday’s decision by a u.s. district judge in hawaii, which limited the scope of the administration’s temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six muslim-majority countries. the latest round in the fight over trump’s march 6 executive order, which he says is needed for national security reasons, came after the supreme court intervened last month to partially revive the two bans, which were blocked by lower courts. the supreme court said then that the ban could take effect, but that people with a “bona fide relationship” to a u.s. person or entity could not be barred.  the administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of hawaii to ask hawaii-based u.s. district judge derrick watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted. he ruled for the state late on thursday. in the court filing, the justice department said the judge’s ruling “empties the (supreme) court’s decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just “close” family members but virtually all family members. the conservative-leaning supreme court is not currently in session but the justices can handle emergency requests. the administration’s application could be directed either to justice anthony kennedy, who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states, or to the nine justices as a whole. if the court as a whole is asked to weigh in, five votes are needed to grant such a request. “the truth here is that the government’s interpretation of the supreme court’s stay order defies common sense,” said omar jadwat, a lawyer with the american civil liberties union involved in challenging the ban. “that’s what the district court correctly found and the attorney general’s misleading attacks on its decision can’t change that fact.” in his decision, watson harshly criticized the government’s definition of close family relations as “the antithesis of common sense.” watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the united states because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation. in the court filing, the justice department said watson’s ruling on refugees would make the supreme court’s decision on that part of the executive order “effectively meaningless.” the ruling, if left in place, means refugees can continue to be resettled in the united states, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. that limit was reached this week.  the supreme court’s decision last month revived parts of trump’s march 6 executive order banning travelers from iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. the court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the u.s. constitution.

      "trump interviews four for fed chair job, to decide in two-three weeks washington (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump is ramping up his search for a new chief for the u.s. central bank, meeting with former federal reserve governor kevin warsh and three others and promising a decision next month. “i’ve had four meetings for fed chairman and i’ll be making a decision over the next two or three weeks,” trump told reporters on the white house south lawn. trump has previously suggested he may reappoint fed chair janet yellen to the post. jerome powell, one of the current governors on the fed’s board, also met with trump earlier this week about the fed job, the wall street journal reported on friday. trump on friday did not provide details on his meetings.  a new fed chair would take the helm as the central bank eases well away from crisis-era policies in response to a strengthening economy and falling unemployment, though inflation still lingers below the fed’s 2-percent goal. under yellen, the fed has raised interest rates and launched a plan to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. much of the latter was accumulated through a controversial bond-buying program that yellen said helped the economy avert an even deeper downturn. her term as chair expires in february.  warsh was a fed governor between 2006 and 2011 and resigned from the board because of his opposition to the bond-buying program. he has called for a revamp of how the fed makes monetary policy, saying it needs “fresh air” from markets and from the “real economy.”  treasury yields spurted higher on news of the trump meetings; warsh is viewed as more of a hawk than yellen. “he’s definitely more hawkish on the spectrum. he is quite a contrast to yellen. it does seem he is the front-runner even though it’s not a sure thing he will be nominated,” gennadiy goldberg, interest rates strategist at td securities in new york, said of warsh. as recently as july, trump had not ruled out reappointing yellen, telling the wall street journal that he liked her demeanor and desire to keep interest rates low. in addition to warsh and powell, stanford university economist john taylor’s name also has been floated as a contender. powell specialized in financial regulatory matters during his five years on the fed board of governors, which is led by the fed chair. there has also been speculation that trump could turn to his top economic aide, gary cohn, for the fed chair position. a fed spokesman declined to comment on the process while warsh and taylor did not respond to requests for comment.

      "trump taps fed centrist powell to lead u.s. central bank washington (reuters) - president donald trump on thursday tapped fed governor jerome powell to become head of the u.s. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying janet yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies. powell, 64, a lawyer and investment banker appointed to the fed board in 2012 by then-president barack obama, emerged as trump’s choice from a slate of possible nominees that included yellen and others who may have pursued a sharp policy shift. in an announcement at the white house, trump described the soft-spoken powell as a smart and committed leader who would build on yellen’s achievements in steering the u.s. economy after the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. “if we are to sustain all this progress, our economy requires sound monetary policy and prudent oversight,” trump said as powell looked on. “we need strong and steady leadership at the u.s. federal reserve ... he will provide exactly that.”   powell has worked alongside yellen for the past five years, backing her direction on monetary policy and, in recent years, sharing her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates. yellen’s four-year term as fed chief ends in early february 2018. she will be the first u.s. central bank chief not to be renominated to a second term since 1979. trump on thursday lauded yellen’s stewardship but did not say why he decided to pass her over for another term. the republican president said he was impressed by powell’s experience in the private-sector and “real-world perspective” to government.  “he understands what it takes for our economy to grow,” trump said. powell, who in the last 25 years has done a prototypical washington circuit of government, private, and think tank jobs, pledged to be attuned to emerging financial risks and the impact the fed has on average americans. he will take over an economy that has been expanding for more than eight years and one that boasts an unemployment rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low.  “monetary policy decisions matter for american families and communities. i strongly share that sense of mission and am committed to making decisions with objectivity and based on the best available evidence,” powell said in brief remarks after trump’s announcement. his nomination now goes to the republican-controlled senate for confirmation. “i’m encouraged by president trump’s choice,” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said in a statement that pledged “timely” consideration of the nomination. there was little apparent market reaction to powell’s nomination, which had been expected. investors were largely focused on the release of details of a republican plan to broadly change the u.s. tax code. by setting benchmark short-term interest rates, the fed broadly influences borrowing and lending conditions in the economy. since the crisis, the central bank has gained more power over the financial sector, while becoming more concerned about issues like income inequality. yellen, a fed veteran who has served at all levels of the sprawling central bank system, said in a written statement that she would work with powell “to ensure a smooth transition.” trump’s decision, after a broad and very public search, offers what analysts said was a classic compromise, allowing him to select his own fed chief while getting continuity with the policies of the yellen-run central bank. “the kernel of what this boiled down to is that in selecting powell, (trump) has all but selected yellen,” said sarah binder, a political science professor at george washington university and author of a recent book on fed politics. “there is not really much daylight, if any.” in june, powell laid out both a defense of the fed’s gradualist path and a critique of those, including some of his competitors for the fed job, who argued the central bank had increased the risk of high inflation and other problems. trump on several occasions has said he would prefer rates to stay low, a position apparently at odds with some of those who were on his short list, particularly stanford university economist john taylor and former fed governor kevin warsh. top white house economic adviser gary cohn also was a contender. powell has been a reliable supporter of the consensus forged by yellen on the policy-setting federal open market committee, and likely will be seen as a less risky choice with the economy growing solidly and u.s. stock markets near record highs. the fed has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again next month. but powell has gone further than his colleagues in calling to relax some of the stricter regulations imposed after the crisis, also important to trump. powell can now pursue that end along with trump appointee randal quarles, the fed’s new vice chair for supervision. though he will be the first fed chief since the late 1970s  without an advanced degree in economics, powell brings market insights, fed board experience and republican ties that analysts say will likely make for a smooth confirmation and transition. under president george h.w. bush, powell oversaw policy on financial institutions and debt markets as an undersecretary of the treasury. from 1997 to 2005 he was a partner at the carlyle group, a private equity firm, and focused on public debt dynamics while at the bipartisan policy center think tank. yellen is entitled to remain as a fed governor until 2024, though previous central bank chiefs have traditionally not stayed once a successor was in place.

      "turkey urges u.s. to review visa suspension as lira, stocks tumble ankara (reuters) - turkey urged the united states on monday to review its suspension of visa services after the arrest of a u.s. consulate employee sharply escalated tension between the two nato allies and drove turkey’s currency and stocks lower. relations between ankara and washington have been plagued by disputes over u.s. support for kurdish fighters in syria, turkey’s calls for the extradition of a u.s.-based cleric and the indictment of a turkish former minister in a u.s. court. but last week’s arrest of a turkish employee of the u.s. consulate in istanbul marked a fresh low. turkey said the employee had links to u.s.-based muslim cleric fethullah gulen, blamed by ankara for a failed military coup in july 2016. gulen denies any connection with the coup. the u.s. embassy in ankara condemned ankara’s charges as baseless and announced on sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in turkey while it reassessed turkey’s commitment to the security of its missions and staff. within hours, ankara announced it was taking the same measures against u.s. citizens seeking visas for turkey. the u.s. ambassador said the duration of the visa services’ suspension would depend on talks between the two governments about the reasons for the detention of local staff in turkey. in a written statement late on monday, ambassador john bass said the length of the suspension would also depend on “the turkish government’s commitment to protecting our facilities and personnel here in turkey”. he noted that the move was not a visa ban on turkish citizens, that valid visas could still be used and visa applications could be made outside of turkey. the u.s. embassy had been unable to learn the reasons for the arrest of its turkish staff member last week or what evidence exists against the employee, bass said, adding that he had not been allowed sufficient access to the employee’s lawyer. justice minister abdulhamit gul said that if washington had serious security concerns about its missions in turkey, steps would be taken to address them. “but if it’s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the turkish judiciary has made,” gul told a haber television. “trying a turkish citizen for a crime committed in turkey is our right.” the turkish foreign ministry summoned a u.s. diplomat to urge the united states to lift the visa services suspension, saying it was causing “unnecessary tensions”, and president tayyip erdogan also criticized the u.s. move. “for the (u.s.) embassy in ankara to take such a decision and implement it, it is upsetting,” erdogan told a news conference during a visit to ukraine. state-run anadolu news agency said another u.s. consulate worker had been summoned to testify over his wife and daughter’s suspected links to gulen - which it said had emerged during the questioning of metin topuz, the employee arrested last week. the diplomatic spat spooked investors. the lira dropped 3.4 percent and stood at 3.7385 against the dollar after being quoted overnight as touching a level of 3.9223. the main bist 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points. airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier turkish airlines falling 9 percent. the central bank said it was following developments closely. “this looks like a really serious situation,” said blue bay asset management strategist timothy ash. he added that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something erdogan has resisted. turkey’s leading business association, tusiad, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly. the row with the united states coincides with deep strains in turkey’s relations with germany, another key ally, and with turkish military activity at the syrian and iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited. u.s.-turkish tensions have risen in recent months over u.s. military support for kurdish ypg fighters in syria, considered by ankara to be an extension of the banned pkk which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast turkey. turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the united states to extradite gulen, viewed in ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed.  friction with the united states has also arisen from the indictment last month by a u.s. court of turkey’s former economy minister zafer caglayan on charges of conspiring to violate u.s. sanctions on iran. sinan ulgen, an analyst and former turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fall-out particularly bitter. “this harshness is a result of a build-up,” he said. “we should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2\n",
      "another u.s. appeals court refuses to revive trump travel ban san francisco/washington (reuters) - president donald trump suffered another legal setback on monday as a second federal appeals court refused to revive his travel ban on people entering the united states from six muslim-majority nations in a dispute headed to the u.s. supreme court. the san francisco-based 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals  used narrow grounds to reject the trump administration’s bid to undo a hawaii federal judge’s decision blocking the temporary ban. it said the republican president’s march 6 order violated existing immigration law. but the three-judge panel - all democratic appointees - did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against muslims. a second court, the richmond, virginia-based 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals, on may 25 upheld a maryland judge’s ruling that also blocked trump’s 90-day ban on travelers from libya, iran, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen.  the 4th circuit had ruled that the ban, which replaced an earlier jan. 27 one also blocked by the courts, “drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination” aimed at muslims. the 9th circuit largely left in place a nationwide injunction by judge derrick watson that stopped parts of the order, which trump said was urgently needed to prevent terrorism in the united states. that ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the order brought by the state of hawaii, which stated the ban would harm its universities and tourism industry. even before monday’s ruling, the case was on the fast track to the supreme court, where the administration on june 1 filed an emergency request seeking to reinstate the order and hear its appeal of the 4th circuit ruling. the supreme court could act on the administration’s request as soon as this week. trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the march order. white house spokesman sean spicer said the administration is reviewing monday’s decision and expressed continued confidence that the order is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the supreme court. “i think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the united states and committing acts of bloodshed and violence,” spicer told a briefing. the 9th circuit upheld the block on trump’s three-month travel ban for the six countries and four-month suspension of all refugee admissions. but the court pared back part of watson’s injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting procedures for these travelers. the administration said the travel ban was needed to allow time to implement stronger vetting measures, although it has already rolled out some new requirements not blocked by courts, including additional questions for visa applicants. rather than focusing on trump campaign statements as the virginia-based court did, the 9th circuit said the language in the executive order itself did not make a rational case for why a travel ban was needed. “the order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality,” the court wrote, referring the combined populations of the six countries.  under immigration law, the administration was required to make findings that entry of the people in question would be detrimental to the united states but failed to do so, the court said. stephen vladeck, a professor at university of texas school of law, said the 9th circuit provided an easier path for the supreme court to keep the travel ban on hold, because it avoided entirely the controversy over trump’s campaign statements.  “it provides a very attractive way to leave the injunction in place without setting broader doctrinal rules about which they may have pause,” vladeck said. trump during the 2016 presidential campaign called for a “total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states.” monday was the deadline for the ban’s challengers to respond to the administration’s request that the order be allowed to go into effect. the american civil liberties union, which represents people challenging the ban in the separate maryland suit handled by the 4th circuit, filed court papers urging the court not to take up the case, saying the order will become moot on wednesday, 90 days from when trump issued it. lawyers for hawaii called the order a “thinly veiled muslim ban.” trump’s earlier jan. 27 order also included iraq among the countries targeted and a total ban on refugees from syria. the march order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban, but was blocked before it could go into effect on march 16. the suits by hawaii and the maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the constitution’s first amendment that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. hawaii’s court papers mentioned a series of trump twitter posts on june 5. trump described the order as a “watered down, politically correct” version of his original one.

       "array([' top trump surrogate brutally stabs him in the back: ‘he’s pathetic’ (video) it s looking as though republican presidential candidate donald trump is losing support even from within his own ranks. you know things are getting bad when even your top surrogates start turning against you, which is exactly what just happened on fox news when newt gingrich called trump  pathetic. gingrich knows that trump needs to keep his focus on hillary clinton if he even remotely wants to have a chance at defeating her. however, trump has hurt feelings because many republicans don t support his sexual assault against women have turned against him, including house speaker paul ryan (r-wi). so, that has made trump lash out as his own party.gingrich said on fox news: look, first of all, let me just say about trump, who i admire and i ve tried to help as much as i can. there s a big trump and a little trump. the little trump is frankly pathetic. i mean, he s mad over not getting a phone call? trump s referring to the fact that paul ryan didn t call to congratulate him after the debate. probably because he didn t win despite what trump s ego tells him.gingrich also added: donald trump has one opponent. her name is hillary clinton. her name is not paul ryan. it s not anybody else. trump doesn t seem to realize that the person he should be mad at is himself because he truly is his own worst enemy. this will ultimately lead to his defeat and he will have no one to blame but himself.watch here via politico:featured photo by joe raedle/getty images',\n",
       "       'u.s. conservative leader optimistic of common ground on healthcare washington (reuters) - republicans in the u.s. house of representatives could achieve common ground on a deal to win support for healthcare legislation on thursday, after president donald trump intervened in negotiations, a conservative leader said on wednesday. “we’re not there yet, but we’re very optimistic that if we work around the clock between now and noon tomorrow, that we’re going to be able to hopefully find some common ground,” representative mark meadows, chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus, told reporters. meadows’ group has opposed house republican healthcare legislation up to now and threatened earlier in the day to block its passage in a thursday vote.

       "       'trump proposes u.s. tax overhaul, stirs concerns on deficit washington (reuters) - president donald trump proposed on wednesday the biggest u.s. tax overhaul in three decades, calling for tax cuts for most americans, but prompting criticism that the plan favors business and the rich and could add trillions of dollars to the deficit. the proposal drew a swift, skeptical response from senator bob corker, a leading republican “fiscal hawk,” who vowed not to vote for any federal tax package financed with borrowed money. “what i can tell you is that i’m not about to vote for any bill that increases our deficit, period,” corker, who said on tuesday he would not seek re-election in 2018, told reporters. trump said his tax plan was aimed at helping working people, creating jobs and making the tax code simpler and fairer. but it faces an uphill battle in the u.s. congress with trump’s own republican party divided over it and democrats hostile. the plan would lower corporate and small-business income tax rates, reduce the top income tax rate for high-earning american individuals and scrap some popular tax breaks, including one that benefits people in high-tax states dominated by democrats. forged during months of talks among trump’s aides and top congressional republicans, the plan contained few details on how to pay for the tax cuts without expanding the budget deficit and adding to the nation’s $20 trillion national debt. the plan still must be turned into legislation, which was not expected until after congress makes progress on the fiscal 2018 budget, perhaps in october. it must then be debated by the republican-led congressional tax-writing committees. analysts were skeptical that congress could approve a tax bill this year, but that is what republicans hope to achieve so they can enter next year’s congressional election campaigns with at least one legislative achievement to show for 2017. financial markets rallied on the plan’s unveiling, an event long anticipated by traders betting that stocks would benefit from both faster economic growth and inflation. at an event in indianapolis, trump called the plan the largest tax cut in u.s. history. “we want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and, yes, tax reform that is pro-american,” he said. the real estate mogul-turned-politician, who promised big tax cuts as a candidate, told reporters he personally would not gain financially from the proposal. “i think there’s very little benefit for people of wealth,” said trump, who unlike many of his white house predecessors, has refused to make public his own tax returns. republicans have produced no major legislative successes since trump took office in january, even though they control the white house and both chambers of congress. their top legislative priority, overhauling the u.s. healthcare system, collapsed again in the senate on tuesday. a comprehensive rewrite of the u.s. tax code has eluded previous presidents and congress for decades. the last one was passed in 1986 under republican president ronald reagan. trump’s plan falls short of the sweeping, bipartisan package crafted by reagan and congressional democrats, analysts said. the white house said that, under the proposal, typical middle-class families would have less income subject to federal tax. trump said the first $12,000 earned by an individual and the first $24,000 by a married couple would be tax-free. the plan would lower the top individual tax rate, paid by the nation’s top earners, to 35 percent from 39.6 percent. it would lower the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. the existing rate is high globally, but many u.s.-based multinationals pay much less than the headline rate because of abundant loopholes and tax breaks. trump has appealed to democrats to back the plan, although they were not consulted in drafting it. republicans hold a thin 52-48 senate majority and may need some democratic support to win passage. but democrats said the plan would expand the federal deficit in order to deliver tax cuts to wealthy americans rather than the middle-class families that trump and republicans say they are trying to help.  “if this framework is all about the middle class, then trump tower is middle-class housing,” said senator ron wyden, the top democrat on the tax law-writing senate finance committee.      republican kevin brady, chairman of the tax-writing house of representatives ways and means committee, said he expected tax legislation to be passed by the end of this year. the committee for a responsible federal budget, a washington-based policy group, estimated on wednesday the plan contained about $5.8 trillion of total tax cuts over a decade and would have a net cost of $2.2 trillion through 2027. analysts have warned huge tax cuts would balloon the deficit if economic growth projected by republicans to offset the costs fails to materialize amid rising interest rates. ‘pass-through’ rate the plan would set a new 25 percent tax rate for “pass-through” businesses, which are usually small, private enterprises, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. they represent about 95 percent of all u.s. businesses. under current law, the profits of those companies “pass through” directly to their owners and are taxed as personal income, often at the top 39.6 percent individual income rate. cutting that to 25 percent could mean big tax savings for small-business owners, but also be vulnerable to abuse by other individuals and companies, analysts said. republicans proposed eliminating some tax deductions. they did not target the popular ones for mortgage interest and charitable giving, but called for scrapping the one for state and local tax payments. that could especially hurt people in high-tax states like california and new york. in a step to simplify tax returns, the plan would shrink the current seven tax brackets to three: 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. that would raise the bottom tax rate on low-earning americans to 12 percent from 10 percent, but analysts said other parts of the plan would still mean a net tax cut.

       "       'trump lawyers say judge lacks jurisdiction for defamation lawsuit new york (reuters) - u.s. president donald trump’s lawyers told a new york state judge on tuesday that under the u.s. constitution she had no jurisdiction over the president and therefore urged her to dismiss a defamation lawsuit by a woman who has accused trump of sexual harassment. the lawsuit by summer zervos, a former contestant on trump’s reality show “the apprentice,” contends that trump’s denials of her accusations amounted to false and defamatory statements. being “branded a liar” by trump, the lawsuit said, has harmed her and her business.  trump’s lawyers, led by marc kasowitz, said the constitution’s supremacy clause prevented the judge from letting zervos’s lawsuit proceed in a state court.  the hour-long hearing was held in new york state supreme court in manhattan, where zervos’s lawyers responded that there was no legal precedent preventing a state court from ruling on the conduct of a president outside his official duties.  “the motion today has nothing to do with putting anyone above the law,” kasowitz told justice jennifer schecter. under the supremacy clause, he said, “a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over the president of the united states while he or she is in office.” schecter occasionally stopped kasowitz to ask him to clarify his views on her jurisdiction. she asked him if it mattered that she would not be directing the president in his official duties, only potentially ruling on whether his comments as a candidate defamed zervos. kasowitz said it made no difference.  “what that means is the president being haled into court, and once the president is haled into court there are innumerable obligations that flow from that,” he said, saying this would amount to inappropriate “control” over the president. mariann wang, the lead lawyer for zervos, argued, “there is no case that holds that a federal official cannot be held to account in a state court.”  trump’s lawyers did not dispute this.  wang acknowledged that the president holds a unique position but noted that even the president has downtime. they could, for example, meet trump during one of his weekend visits to his mar-a-lago resort in florida to record a video deposition, she suggested. the judge said she would rule later. trump’s lawyers have said in court filings that zervos is making false, self-contradictory and politically motivated accusations and that the president’s remarks were “non-actionable fiery rhetoric.” zervos has accused trump of groping her during meetings in 2007. she filed her lawsuit in january, three days before trump’s inauguration. in march, she subpoenaed trump’s presidential campaign for any documents concerning similar allegations against him.  trump has said accusations by zervos and other women who last year accused him of sexual harassment are false. if the case went ahead, it could lead to trump being compelled to hand over any documents from his campaign related to any accusations of sexual impropriety made against him.  zervos’s lawyers, including gloria allred, have cited the u.s. supreme court’s ruling in clinton v. jones, which allowed former arkansas state employee paula jones’ sexual harassment lawsuit against bill clinton to proceed in 1997 while he was still u.s. president.  the decision led to clinton’s impeachment after he lied under oath about his sexual relationship with another woman, monica lewinsky. trump’s lawyers have said that clinton v. jones only applies to lawsuits in federal courts, not state courts. zervos met trump after becoming a contestant on nbc’s “the apprentice” in 2005. she has accused trump of kissing her against her will at his new york office in 2007 and later groping her in a hotel in beverley hills after she met with him about a possible job. she was one of several women who made accusations against trump after the emergence last year of a conversation caught on an open microphone in 2005 in which he spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. trump has said the comments amounted to “locker room banter,” and his campaign issued a statement in which he apologized if anyone was offended. since the lawsuit was filed, numerous accusations of sexual misconduct have been made against powerful men in politics, media and entertainment.

       "       ' watch: right-wing pastor falsely credits trump for saving the auto industry in 2008 remember that time in 2008 when donald trump rode in on a white horse and personally saved the auto industry all by himself? yeah, me neither. but one of his supporters thinks that actually happened.during an interview on cnn, trump s favorite pastor, darrell scott, stunned former detroit mayor dennis archer and new day host alisyn camerota by making that exact claim after trashing the michigan city as a hellhole that only the republican nominee can fix. detroit is in bad shape,  scott said.  it s in bad shape economically, it s in bad shape as far as crime is concerned, and so you have a candidate that s saying,  i want to improve the conditions of the city economically, i want to improve the condition of the city as far as crime is concerned    you can t turn a deaf ear to that, whoever it is. archer took umbrage to scott s characterization of the city and warned that voters should scrutinize candidates who make such promises, especially since trump didn t give a damn about detroit before his poll numbers imploded.camerota asked scott to continue, and when he did he gave trump credit for something that president bush and president obama did in 2008 and 2009 respectively. you have someone saying,  i m going to be put in a position to help detroit in the areas that it most needs help,  scott went on.  he bailed out the auto industry. yes, scott really did claim that trump save the auto industry at the height of the great recession.of course, the record is crystal clear that president bush signed the first bailout of chrysler and general motors. when president obama took office the next year he did even more to help the american auto industry to stay alive and continue competing with foreign automakers.the auto industry is now fully recovered in this country and donald trump has absolutely nothing to do with it, something scott realized moments later as he clumsily attempted to correct himself. i mean, he just, uh, he didn t bail out the auto industry,  scott embarrassingly admitted.  what i m saying is, he had been working in relationship with the auto industry in order to stimulate the american auto industry. here s the video via twitter.heated debate over donald trump s outreach to black voters https://t.co/sdqciimnc1  new day (@newday) september 2, 2016once again, a trump supporter humiliates himself on national television by getting the facts completely wrong. at least scott had the decency to correct himself this time.featured image: getty images',\n",
